### **✨ Project Highlights**

Deepfake voices can be **alarmingly realistic**, posing risks for security and trust. This project provides a professional-grade AI tool to **detect** and **analyze** deepfake audio quickly and accurately via a web interface.

  * 📂 **Multi-Format Support**: Upload `.wav` and `.mp3` files for instant analysis.
  * ⚡ **Instant Predictions**: Get a clear **REAL** or **FAKE** classification with a probability score.
  * 📊 **Explainable AI (LIME)**: Visually interpret results by highlighting which spectrogram regions influenced the model's decision.
  * 🔊 **Built-in Audio Playback**: Listen to uploaded samples directly within the app.
  * 📁 **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple files with a single upload and export a CSV summary.
